# CODSOFT--Task-4-SPAM-SMS-DETECTION
This repository contains a spam SMS detection system developed during a CodSoft internship. The project focuses on classifying text messages as spam or non-spam using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview:
### Problem Definition and Data Collection
The project aims to identify and filter spam messages from legitimate communications. Data is collected from a labeled dataset of SMS messages, categorized as 'spam' or 'ham.'

### Data Preprocessing
The data undergoes text cleaning, normalization, tokenization, and feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF to prepare it for analysis.

### Model Selection and Training
The Machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression is used to build and train the model on the preprocessed data.

### Model Evaluation and Optimization
The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy and Classification. Techniques like hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are applied to optimize the model.

### Deployment and Monitoring
The trained model is deployed to classify incoming SMS messages in real-time. Continuous monitoring ensures the model remains effective and adapts to new spam patterns.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning for effective spam detection in SMS messages, showcasing practical skills in model development and deployment.
